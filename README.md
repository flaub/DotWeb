DotWeb - .NET Web Toolkit
===

This is a clone of GWT for the .NET platform.

Primary Components:
* A transpiler, turning MSIL into Javascript, allowing any .NET language to be used for client-side web development.
* An integrated debugger, allowing developers to set breakpoints and step through client-side code in the original language (C# is preferred).
