Cecil is a library to generate and inspect programs and libraries in the ECMA CIL format.

* Building

	The standard Makefile works inside /mcs (SVN or tarball). If you want to build
	Cecil as a standalone library (e.g. in /cecil SVN) you'll need to:

		./configure --prefix=/your/prefix
		make -f standalone.make
		make -f standalone.make install
