DotWeb - CHANGELOG

Version 0.2 [Jan 04, 2010]
==========================
* Introducing DotWeb.System in order to emulate mscorlib in the browser.
* In order to support client-side code that references DotWeb.System inside
  of development-mode, a code weaver is added to fixup references from
  DotWeb.System back to the real mscorlib. This allows System.Activator and
  System.Reflection to work correctly.

Version 0.1 [Sep 02, 2009]
==========================

* Initial release.
